# Leanplum Segment Integration for iOS
Leanplum SDK integration for the Segment iOS SDK.

## Installation
To install the Leanplum Segment integration, simply add this line to your
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) Podfile:
```ruby
pod 'LeanplumSegment', '~> 1.0.1'
```
That's it! Now you can use the Segment SDK and also the [advanced features](https://www.leanplum.com/docs#/docs) of the Leanplum SDK.

### Install Specific Version of SDK's
By default this integration pulls in the latest versions of the Leanplum SDK and the Segment SDK. If you rather want to use a specific version, simply specify the required versions in your podfile directly.
```ruby
pod 'Analytics', '3.0.1'
pod 'Leanplum-iOS-SDK', '1.2.23'
```

## Usage
Import the LeanplumSegment integration:
```objc
#import <LeanplumSegment/SEGLeanplumIntegrationFactory.h>
```
Add the following lines to your AppDelegate or Controller:
```objc
NSString *const SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY = @" ... ";
SEGAnalyticsConfiguration *config =
    [SEGAnalyticsConfiguration configurationWithWriteKey:SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY];
[config use:[SEGLeanplumIntegrationFactory instance]];
[SEGAnalytics setupWithConfiguration:config];
```
Now you can use Segment as you are used to, e.g.:
```objc
[[SEGAnalytics sharedAnalytics] track:@" ... "];
```
In addition to that you can also use the advanced features of Leanplum, e.g.:
```objc
[Leanplum onVariablesChanged:^{
    ...
}];
```
